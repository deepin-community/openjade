README for the OpenJade contrib directory
-----------------------------------------

This directory contains software and documentation that are not an
integral part of OpenJade -- that is, they are not part of a DSSSL
implementation. They may or may not be useful. Your pointage may 
vary.

Here's a list of what's in this directory:

rtf2doc.pl - a Perl script which will take .rtf files generated by 
    Jade and convert them to Word .doc format. In the process, 
    referenced graphic files will be embedded into the documents,
    and page numbers references will be resolved. Requires MS Word
    97.d

psgml-jade.el - an addition to psgml (a powerful SGML mode for Emacs)
    which makes it easy to apply a DSSSL style sheet to an SGML document 
    from within the editor. It also contains a framework to enable
    menu-driven customization of DSSSL style sheets. Requires 
    psgml-dsssl.el and customize.dtd.

psgml-dsssl.el - creates a skeleton DSSSL style sheet for an SGML document.

customize.dtd - a dtd derived from the DSSSL architecture which includes
    information about user-settable variables and characteristics. This
    allows menu-driven customization.

jadetex - the JadeTeX macros needed to process the output of the TeX 
    backend used to be included here.  However, they were removed;
    just get them from upstream:
