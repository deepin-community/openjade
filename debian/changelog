openjade (1.4devel1-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: COPYING inadvertently was changed to GPL, which applies
    to debian/ dir, not whole package.  Reverted back to COPYING from
    upstream, which appears to be BSD-derived. Does away with cmp that
    caused FTBFS in prior Debian version.

  * Updated to Standards-Version: 3.6.1 (no changes).
  * Depend on debhelper >= 4.1.75 to pick up bug fixes for dh_installcatalogs.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Oct 2003 22:50:37 -0400

openjade (1.4devel1-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up debian/rules:
  - Set DH_COMPAT=4, debhelper version to (>=4).
  - Used libtool 1.5 for autotools generated files, so C++ gets used for
    linking, ensuring that libs get linked with libstdc++, and removed
    gruesome sed hacks that were necessary to do this with libtool 1.4.
  - Fixed copyright file: was a copy of GPL plus some text that referenced
    /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL, now it is the actual copyright notice,
    the reference, and the Debian copyright info.
  - Let debhelper tools do shlibs and substvars generation instead of
    explicitly doing it in rules.
  - Added openjade-1.4devel1 man page (closes: #191738)
  * Updated to Standards-Version: 3.6.0.
  * Removed libtool from Build-Depends.

  * Remove use of autotools from regular package build.

    package.  I find it useful, I suppose others might, too.
  * Added *.gmo to files removed in clean target of makefile in subdir po.
    They get built if not there, and were causing a binary file difference
    error when building the package.
  * Fixed improperly defined 'attribute' function in builtins.dsl; changed
    parameter name from 'string' to 'name'. (closes: #145242)
  * Incorporated patch to fix quoting of '&' in XML backend.  Will push
    upstream. (closes: #147073)

  * problem fixed a while ago where we weren't shipping the HTML
    documentation

  * Japanese translation added upstream
  * debian/rules: make maintainer-clean upstream is incredibly fragile,
    so tolerate errors there until that gets fixed
  * debian/rules: during build, run libtoolize --force to replace this
    libtoolize stuff, which is needed for arches which diverge from the
    libtool stuff OpenSP ships with
  * debian/rules, control: use dh_shlibdeps, remove some hand-rolled stuff
    here which was unnecessary and in fact adding two libosp deps on the
    opensp package, not to mention that it stopped working

    this is proper -- it certainly inhibits some warnings
