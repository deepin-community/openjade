Description: Implementation of the DSSSL language
 OpenJade is an implementation of the ISO/IEC 10179:1996 standard
 DSSSL language.  It is based on James Clark's Jade software.
 .
 The OpenJade processor, in conjunction with a DSSSL style sheet, is
 capable of translating SGML documents into other formats.  Output
 formats currently supported are RTF, HTML, MIF, JadeTeX, or an XML
 representation of the flow object tree.  Using its own non-standard
 system, it is also capable of transforming one SGML or XML DTD to
 another.
